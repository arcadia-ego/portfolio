Forget "stacks". Forget languages, forget algorithms. What did Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace have when they furrowed their
brows and set about working on the promethean computer?  

They had a problem.  

Of course, algorithms, languages and stacks have arisen very naturally as perfect solutions to many problems. But not one solution is key for every problem, and the innovations of yesterday are often obsoleted. That's why, as a web developer, I believe it's important
to start with the fundamentals.  

At Lambda School, we spent a lot of time on _how_ specific technologies worked. Even more than that, we spent time on _why_ they worked. The MERN stack is an extremely powerful tool that is quite versatile, but we were taught to have no such loyalties to one particular technology. For example, the list of advantages that SQL has against NoSql, and vice versa, is quite long. The most powerful tool at your disposal, however, is your fellow human. Working on a team is a key component of being a web developer. In today's world, remote teams separated by time zone, culture and language are becoming increasingly common.  

The work of a web developer often consists of stapling various, disparate tools together into an elegant solution that just one piece would not be able to solve. But being able to know _what_ to choose, and when pre-fabricated solutions fail you, what to _create_, makes all the difference in the world.
