Forget "stacks". Forget languages, forget algorithms. What did Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace have when they furrowed their
brows and set about working on the promethean computer?

They had a problem.

Of course, algorithms, languages and stacks have arisen very naturally as perfect solutions to many problems. But not one solution is key for every problem, and the innovations of yesterday are often obsoleted. That's why, as a web developer, I believe it's important
to start with the fundamentals. The stronger your foundations are with Javascript, for example, the less shaky you will be when you stand at the top of the Redux skyscraper.

At Lambda School, we spent a lot of time on _how_ specific technologies worked. The MERN stack (the main stack that we learned at Lambda) is a powerful tool that is quite versatile, but we were taught to have no such loyalties to one particular technology. In our case, MERN was simply the introduction to a wider world. Learning how to break down issues and identify what tool is best at that moment is the essence of being a programmer. When I first started, I could hardly explain what a for-loop was. Just looking at written C was enough to cause anxiety. But eventually, once you realize how woven the fundamentals are within everything, it becomes a matter of recognizing patterns and fitting new ideas into a framework you can understand. _That_ is what Lambda School specializes in, not each individual puzzle piece necessarily, but fitting them together.


###Outside of computers...
The most powerful asset is your fellow human. In today's world, remote teams separated by time zone and culture are becoming increasingly common. Since Lambda offers an online education, learning to excel in such an environment was a large part of the 6+ month experience. Working with a diverse set of personalities across large geographical distances towards a common goal was the mainstay of our Capstone projects. Being able to step back and analyze your own perspective, whether it be to re-evaluate or explain it better, is integral to learning and growing your skill set. 

The work of a web developer often consists of combining various, disparate tools together into an elegant solution that just one piece would not be able to solve. But being able to know _what_ to choose, and when pre-fabricated solutions fail you, what to _create_, makes all the difference in the world.
